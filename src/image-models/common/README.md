# Common image sizes

Resizes images to a set of common widths (listed below) and and optimises at three levels

## Image sizes 

- 768
- 960
- 1024
- 1280
- 1440
- 1920
- 2048

## Compression
As the sizes are large pixel dimensions, we employ three, increasingly agressive levels of compression, the intention being to choose the best compromise between file size and quality.

- **Medium:** jpeg at 40% quality. Reliably good quality but with larger file size.
- **Heavy:** jpeg at 30% quality. Usually the best compromise at this resolutions
- **Ultra:** jpeg at 10% quality. Significant file size savings that can be viable in this scenario where images are rendered at 1/4 the pixel dimensions which can hide alot of compression artifacts.
