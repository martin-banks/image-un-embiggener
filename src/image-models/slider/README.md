# Editorial tools slider
For use with Kurator Editorial Tools slider (carousel) template.

All source images are processed at two resolutions with three different compression levels.


## Resolutions
The slider tool supports two different image resolutions to different scenarios. All images are processed at both, meaning that if the same image is to be used in both scenarios an optimal format is available.

- **Mobile:** 800px wide
- **Desktop:** 1300px wide

## Compression
As the sizes are large pixel dimensions, we employ three, increasingly agressive levels of compression, the intention being to choose the best compromise between file size and quality.

- **Medium:** jpeg at 40% quality. Reliably good quality but with larger file size.
- **Heavy:** jpeg at 30% quality. Usually the best compromise at this resolutions
- **Ultra:** jpeg at 10% quality. Significant file size savings that can be viable in this scenario where images are rendered at 1/4 the pixel dimensions which can hide alot of compression artifacts.
